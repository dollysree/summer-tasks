"That was the beginning of China. That was the beginning of India, when India -- by the way, India is doing great. Nobody talks about it. And I have big jobs going up in India. But India is doing great," Trump said.\r\n\r\nBut that was the beginning of China. That was the beginning of India. Look at everything I told you. Everything I told you is all right, whether it''s Iraq, whether it''s Iran, whether it''s China, whether it''s India, whether it''s Japan," Trump said referring to his CNN interview in September 2007.\r\n\r\n"Just look at this country. We have gone from this tremendous power that was respected all over the world to somewhat of a laughing stock," he said.\r\n\r\n"All of a sudden, people are talking about China and India and other places, even from an economic standpoint. America has come down a long way, a long way. The United States has come down a long way, and it''s very, very sad. We''re not respected, he added. '),

It is important for us to continue building better understanding and trust between us since that will help to maintain a strong and healthy relationship between India and China," he said. \r\n\r\nHis assertion about India''s desire to build friendship with China comes after US announcement about a major push into the Asia-Pacific, specially the South China Sea, where China is grappling with maritime disputes with a host of countries. \r\n\r\nChinese analysts feel that the US is wooing India in a bid to counter China''s growing influence in Asia-Pacific. \r\n\r\nUS Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, who announced Washington''s plans to deploy 60 per cent of US naval assets in the Asia-Pacific in the next few years raising strong concerns in Beijing, is currently in India seeking to strength US-India military ties.

"The CAMPA fund is Rs 42,000 crore and each state would have got around Rs 2,000-3,000 crore each," he said.\r\n\r\nThe PM''s swipe had Congress benches murmuring in disagreement and Sharma quickly responded, saying "Political opponents should not be seen as personal opponents ... you should consider them as people with a different political ideology and treat them accordingly."\r\n\r\nHe added, "We hope that an atmosphere is created where the current bitterness is eradicated as all people have to work together to build our society. The government''s role in building consensus is important. Opposition also has a role but government has a bigger role."\r\n\r\nThe exchange reflected the polarised politics in Parliament as Modi, without naming Congress, blamed it for hindering development.\r\n\r\nModi said MPs in Rajya Sabha should work for the interests of the states they represent, adding that states stood to benefit the most from GST. "It would have been better if two critical decisions had also been approved," he said. "Bihar would benefit from GST, UP would benefit from GST. Barring one or two ... all states would have benefited." He added that MPs, who will return to the House, will get another chance to pass the legislation.\r\n\r\nHad the CAMPA bill been passed, it would have unlocked funds before the monsoon and the money would have reached the people. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly refer to it, the bill''s passage has been hit by Congress MP Jairam Ra mesh''s amendment seeking to make consent of 50 per cent gram sabha members man datory for any CAMPA-funded project, envisaging situations like displacement of forest dwellers and tribals.\r\n\r\nThe Lok Sabha has al ready approved the constitu tional amendment but it re mains pending in Rajya Sab ha, where the ruling NDA does not have a majority.\r\n\r\n"This (Rs 2,000-3,000 crore) is not a small amount," he said with regard to CAMPA funds, adding that availability of the money before the monsoon season would have greatly benefited the states.\r\n\r\n"We will have to wait for 4-5 months now," Modi said. GST, which is to subsume all indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax into a single standard rate, was to be implemented from April 1, 2016 but opposition from Congress over key clauses, including putting a cap on the tax rate in the constitutional amendment bill, had stalled its passage in the Rajya Sabha.'),

There will be no extra charge for the service, a statement issued by the ministry said. The process is subject to online validation of the Aadhaar number while processing and an approval from the granting officer.\r\n\r\nIn addition, EPIC and PAN cards may also be validated, if required, through respective databases in real time, before the application is approved. Besides, passports may also be impounded and revoked later, in case of adverse police reports.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the upgrade is to liberalise the process without compromising on security, explained Anil Kumar Sobti, director of the passport division in the ministry. "There are plenty of inbuilt safeguards in our system which can instantly spot fake identities and forgeries. Most importantly, our system is linked to the Aadhaar database which helps conduct real-time verification of the applicant while s/he is still at the passport seva kendra," he said.');

It is obvious that students will be bored listening to the same old lectures every day. Practical classes play a vital role in making excellent engineers. One needs on the job experience before sitting for a job interview. One needs to know what happens in the industry and must have some knowledge related to their job. But the question is, is it necessary to have some knowledge about work experience before doing your internship? Yes, of course. For this reason as well as to encourage the youth and appreciate their work, NIT Rourkela has launched AMDOCS 6 month project, program or AMDOCS cloud-based innovation lab for all pre final year students and not for the final year students as they will be busy looking for jobs and in their project work. Hence, it is like a preparation before you join a job or do your internship. Recently i.e., on 8th of August, two professors from our institute, S. K. Jena and B. D. Sahoo, attended a conference in Pune, Maharastra, to discuss and start this cloud-based innovation lab. According to Mr. S. K. Jena,\r\n\r\nThe course offered by this program is not generally covered in the engineering syllabus. This is specifically for helping students know more about the industry and to gain knowledge about what they do in companies before going for their summer internships.\r\nAMDOCS innovative lab is an innovative cloud learning portal providing a personalized role and scenario based learning experience that improves employee performance. Students from various colleges will be participating in this program. Interested candidates will be selected by the institute and made into groups of 5-7 students each. They will interact with the employees of AMDOCS through video conference and gain some work related knowledge and simultaneously start working on their projects. Students will be evaluated through these 6 months thoroughly and by the end of the program, one group will be selected on the basis of their work, project and innovative ideas. Such selected group from every college will be offered an opportunity to conduct a presentation at Pune and the best group which can be from any participating institutes, will be awarded with a prize money of INR One Lakh. This project will not only ensure a lifetime experience of a student, a future employee would need to manage between the various spheres of the job. The students would have an access to a cloud storage where all the required information would be available at any hour of the day. Though the official eligibility for this project are pre-final year of B Tech degree students, dual degree are also allowed to participate in this. This ambitious project would be a lifetime project for the students as well as the professors associated with it. Team MM wishes department of Computer Science and Engineering good luck so that the project not only takes off but comes with flying colours.', 'Sampoojya'),
(19, 'AIM HIGHER: NEW YEAR, NEW TARGETS', 'aim-higher-new-year-new-targets', '', 'In the 21st century, technology is omnipresent in our lives. With a boom in the technology sector, it is proving to be a lucrative career opportunity for students, who are at the juncture to pass out from school and are considering different career options. Computer Science and Engineering is one of the most popular courses for all engineering aspirants. NIT Rourkela has a well established Department of Computer Science and Engineering which produces a fresh batch of bright minds, with every passing year. The new Head of Department, Prof. D.K. Mohapatra, has set down a few new rules to be followed and targets to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nHis first target is to set up class rooms in the department itself. The extension of the department has obviously increased the number of rooms, giving the professors an opportunity to conduct classes in the department instead of conducting them in LA. His second target is to set up new laboratories since the existing laboratories in the department are too small to accommodate strengths of around 110 students. For this, the HOD has already set up all the computers and furniture that will be needed using a generous budget of 35 lakhs provided by the government of India.\r\n\r\nHis third target is to set up one laboratory for each professor. Currently, there are 19 professors among which only 9 are the in-charges of one research laboratory, each. Prof. Mohapatra’s fourth target is to contact agencies like TCS, INFOSYS, and IBM to set up some excellent laboratories at our institute. This will not only increase the standard of the department but also boost the internship opportunities in these companies and eventually lead to an increase in the number of placements.\r\n\r\nTo increase Institute Industry Interaction, he said that there will be seminars and expert lectures conducted for students which is also his fifth target. Besides the normal B. Tech course, there is a M. Tech program on analytics and decision sciences which is a multidisciplinary course. Here the participants maybe from CSE, mathematics or some other departments. Hence, the Dean(AC), Prof. B. Majhi, is planning to provide rooms for other departments in the extension part of computer science department so that it can help the students from other departments to take this course.\r\n\r\nLast mission is to increase the number of faculty as currently, there is faculty shortage. Team MM wishes the Department of CSE greater success in this academic year.', 'Sampoojya'),
(20, 'BIO-INFOMATICS WORKSHOP', 'bio-infomatics-workshop', '', 'The Department of Computer Science and Engineering recently held a workshop on ''Biometric Security: Theory and Applications'' from 15 - 19 March 2016. Its main objective was to spread awareness of biometric security among faculties and researchers of different universities. A total of 34 participants: 28 external (12 faculties and 16 research students) from Kolkata Raipur, Jamshedpur, Sambalpur, Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack, 06 internal students from CSE participated in the program.\r\n\r\nThe courses had 20 hours’ lecture and 15 hours’ laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe course presented the fundamentals and the research aspects of biometric security.

(21, 'PREPARING FOR THE PERFORMANCE: NIT CONCLAVE 2016', 'preparing-for-the-performance-nit-conclave-2016', '', 'The 6th NIT Conclave, is an event in which students from all the National Institutes of Technology from across the country will participate. NITR is proud to be the host institute for this extravaganza, which has been scheduled for 2nd September 2016- 4th September 2016. It will be a platform for representatives from different NITs to meet and discuss about the problems in their parent institutes and come up with simple and innovative solutions for the same. Team MM met with the organizers of the Conclave to find out about the preparations that are underway.\r\n\r\nTheme – A Bird’s Eye View:\r\n\r\nEvery conclave has a theme of its own and this time the organizers have zeroed in on “Research: A Special Focus on Undergraduate Research”. The theme is particularly important for an institute like ours which strives to promote postgraduate studies and research among students. However, undergraduate research is different from postgraduate research in the sense that one needn’t find a different alternative for an existing idea, but can improve or streamline an existing one. In our institute undergraduate research has two avenues the final year B. Tech Project and the Product Development Laboratory. While the B. Tech project is fairly common to all NITs, the Product Development lab is unique to our institute. Thus one of the agendas for the conclave will include identifying such novelties in various institutions and incorporating them in others. According to Anup Mittal, one of the organizers of the conclave\r\n\r\nWe need to understand that the real progress in a country is very closely linked to product and process development. For example, in Singapore since there is a problem regarding water scarcity, they are innovating alternatives which will make them self-sufficient in the next 50 years. Thus, the main objective of this conclave is to educate the young minds and increase their awareness about using technology to solve everyday problems.\r\nEvent Calendar:\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the conclave there is going to be guest a lecture. Even though the dignitary for the lecture has not been confirmed yet, the organizers said that they were talking with Ms. Kiran Majumdar Shaw. However, in case she cannot make it due to date issues, they have also contacted Dr. Anil Gupta and Dr. Sivathanu Pillai for the same event. The name of guest speaker will be revealed, with due confirmations from the respective party by the end of the week.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, representatives from different NITs will deliver their presentations and this will be followed by an informal brainstorming session to discuss the findings of the showcase. A drafting process has been scheduled for the third day, where a panel discussion will be arranged for students to pitch in their ideas and improve existing processes. Even though, there is no surety, the organizers are planning to send this document to the MHRD for their consideration, since it will deal with subjects pertinent to all the institutes. However, the organizers are still struggling to make ends meet, and they believe the delay in getting the process started can be because of the change in administration. Currently, they have started and are in the process of inducting a team of 30-35 members which will be split into sections such as Management, Content, Technical and Presentation to ease the entire proceedings of the conclave.\r\n\r\nAccommodation:\r\n\r\nArrangements have been made for the participants from different NITs to stay in S. D. Hall of Residence and C. V. R. Hall of Residence. There are 251 rooms in the boys’ hostel which will be sufficient since the organisers are expecting 150 students from all the NITs. However, there is severe shortage of space in the ladies’ hostel, and if they cannot accommodate participants there, then they will be living in S. D. Hall of Residence, as well, but in different blocks. This arrangement had been used during Zonasa that was conducted the previous year – however, it is yet to be approved by the Chief Warden.\r\n\r\nMoney Matters:\r\n\r\nAfter attending the previous year’s Conclave, representatives from NITR had approached the former Director, Prof. S. K. Sarangi and expressed their desire of hosting the event. After his approval, the previous Dean (Student Welfare), Prof. K. C. Pati had delegated INR 3 lakhs from the SAC budget for the Conclave even though the organizers had initially quoted an estimated amount of INR 4.18 lakhs. However, after the change in administration the organizers confess that they have been facing certain fund related issues, especially because SAC executives are now reluctant to sanction the money. They believe that rather than investing in such a ‘one-time’ event, they could use the money for the betterment of the regular fests that are annually conducted in the institute.  \r\n\r\nSince the decision to organize the conclave at NITR was taken under the tenure of our former Director and Dean (Student Welfare), the administrational changes have left the organizing committee in a hapless condition, and thus their focus has shifted from team management to funding related issues.\r\nHowever, the interim director has been supportive and has ensured the students that if SAC funds are not enough, institute funds will be sanctioned. The organizers are a little sceptical about this situation since institute funds are even harder to be sanctioned and the procedure of acquiring them is slow.\r\n\r\nHowever, on contacting Prof. Japes Bera, President, SAC, he said,\r\n\r\nThis matter hasn’t been brought to my attention, till now. Since, I do not have complete information I can’t comment on this issue right now.\r\nAlumni Relations – Added Agenda:     \r\n\r\nIn most NITs the involvement of alumni in the process of funding, as well as providing valuable inputs for better organization has helped them to a large extent. However, for such relations to be implemented, our alumni network has to be strong. Since, there is a continuous influx and outflow of people into the student-alumni network of all NITs as a whole. It’s important to bring about stability so that the ideas that are discussed regarding how alumni can help current students can be implemented.\r\n\r\nInteraction unfortunately is not the only thing which will help create a useful alumni network. The collaboration of alumni with students on projects and technical developments is a good platform to build relations. But, unless professors help students to contact selected alumni who are interested to help, it will be difficult for students to identify them. Organizing Committee member, Abhratej Sahoo says,\r\n\r\nIn essence, the whole problem boils down to a triangle between the faculty, students and alumni who must work together in order to achieve any tangible results or benefits.” \r\nIf the Conclave is successfully carried out, then it will certainly bring praise to the institute. Issues such as funding and accommodation may plague the organizers at the moment, but we can surely hope that these glitches will be addressed and sorted out well before time. Team MM wishes the NIT Conclave organizers luck in this novel attempt at trying to make a place for ourselves on the national map.', 'Debashish'),

Before the onset of summer vacations itself, there had been notable improvements implemented within its premises. The installation of wall mounted dustbins was a significant step taken to control the menace caused by stray dogs entering the hostel and knocking off the dustbins placed on floor in search of food. The corridors and washrooms have been cleaner and hygienic to a larger extent since. Dark coloured curtains were put up along widows in every room and those near the washrooms to ensure sufficient privacy to the boarders.\r\n\r\nOver the past few months as well, there have been developments in the hostel premises in various fields. Block-B, being the one where the mess is stationed, has always had greater water requirements than the other blocks. To tackle the dilemma of water shortage in it, which was evident during last year, an extra pipe has been provided for the block, increasing the supply of water twofold. There have been upgrades in the equipment used in the kitchen. Procurement of new utensils is underway, so as to cater to the increased number of boarders this year. A new room has been created in the mess for cleaning dirty utensils, along with a separate extended corridor for the convenience of mess staff. To boost the fitness quotient, small yet progressive steps have been taken. As conveyed by the former general secretary:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe gym in the common room, which had been dysfunctional since long now, has had a few of its equipment repaired lately.\r\n \r\n\r\nBoarders had faced some serious health problems due to the drinking water quality in B-block in the last semester. When questioned about this, the warden said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe water coolers are being cleaned with increased frequency to avoid any health issues and there have been no complaints mentioned so far.\r\n \r\n\r\nBefore the new boarders arrived for this session, walls of a few rooms which had been spoilt the year before with colours were distempered and repainted.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few promising plans for the upcoming year, like regular trimming of plants and bushes near the boundary walls of the hall along with prevention of growth of weeds to give way for plantation of trees like papaya, and building a toilet in the visitor’s room- in accordance with the requests of the boarders’ parents. Apart from that, the mess menu will take an overhaul and the warden reassured:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere will be a new menu decided for the mess soon after the hall elections results are declared, taking into account the boarders’ suggestions, and the menu will undergo a change, once in every two months.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of productive schemes in process to make use of the space in between the buildings by creating gardens. In front of Block-D, creation of a herbal garden has been planned, and its fencing is already complete. Plants of medicinal use, like Aloe Vera and holy basil (Tulsi) will be planted in the garden, and it will be lined with mustard plants. There are intentions of having a seasonal garden which will have different variety of flowers throughout the year.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of those visiting the new canteen, cemented benches will be constructed near it. Also, there are plans of converting a small broken building within the premises into the night canteen with a dining area, by merging the small rooms present to create a large dining space.\r\n\r\nTo present an overview, the developments that have come about have been gradual; but the outline for this academic year seems firm and reassuring. We genuinely hope the proposals work out, and KMS turns into an even finer abode for the students.', 'Sriya Sainath'),

The new members of NIT family were explained about some basic astronomical features and shown the reasons to come under the wings of the club and become a part of its upcoming records.\r\n\r\nThe programme commenced at 6:20 pm with a small address by the President, Aditya Narendra and a turnout of around 60 students from both fresher and sophomore years. A series of presentations were then presented to explain the crowd about some astronomical phenomena discovered in space. The first presentation was presented by Arohan Paul, Technical head, where he explained about Wormholes that consist of two mouths connected by a throat and when an object passes through one hole it emerges out instantly through the other end, despite of the fact that the holes are present trillions of miles away from each other. These bodies allow superluminal travel and can be created by threading of negative energy called exotic matter.\r\n\r\nIt was then succeeded by Kanhu Pal, who explained about the phenomenal science behind the gigantic waves on Miller’s planet. He gave a precise explanation about the scientific reason of formation of tides in oceans only. The next presentation was by Aditya Narendra, who explained about Blackholes. These are formed from collapsing of a star much more massive than the sun and then warping of space time. He then moved on to explain about a super massive blackhole named Gargantua and how gravitational time dilation occurs in these celestial bodies and thus correlating this time dilation concept with the high gravity on Miller’s planet.\r\n\r\nThen the crowd was addressed by Aanchal Chaurasia, who explained about TARS, one of three former U.S. Marine Corps featured in the movie Interstellar. The vision behind TARS was to create a user-friendly system that creates an adequate job of assisting humans. She then explained about the famous director Christopher Nolan’s design of TARS and how some challenges were faced in implementing the concept in the movie.\r\n\r\nAfter the series of interactive talks with the crowd, came a brief presentation by the President on the foundation of Astro and how it has manifested itself within all these years. In the previous academic year, Astro conducted events and workshops like Cosmos 3D, Stellarium workshop, Astronomica, Sky watch, WarpEd 2016 to name some which gained a commendable turnout. A few slides were presented depicting the pictures of various celestial bodies, constellations and nebulas being clicked after viewing from the team’s telescope, Celestron.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith events like WarpEd 2.0, Bounty Hunter 2.0 in the pipeline, Team MM congratulates and wishes good luck to the Astro team for its future plans and endeavours ahead', 'Gyan Prakash');
